This is an analysis of a database that includes `r nrow(dat_raw)` ECGs 
on `r extract_n_subj(dat_raw)` individual patients from `r age_range` years 
of age who were pregnant at least once between 2011 to 2024 in a single 
tertiary medical center. 
Univariate and multiple generalized linear mixed effect models with a 
random effect for pregnancy identifier were fit to evaluate associations 
between four ECG features 
(QRS interval, QTc interval, PR interval, and heart rate) 
and pregnancy after 6 weeks and by trimester compared to ECG features in 
women who were not pregnant nor within 6 months postpartum.
