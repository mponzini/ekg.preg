Pregnancy is a physiologic high-volume state, starting 6 weeks after conception. 
Physiologic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes in pregnancy have been reported but not well characterized. 
We hypothesize that the odds of identifying certain ECG features related to decreased QRS interval, QTc interval, PR interval, and increased heart rate are higher during normal pregnancy, reflecting the physiologic cardiac volume and compliance changes. 
The objective of this study is to evaluate ECG changes in normal pregnancies by trimester compared to women who are not pregnant.
